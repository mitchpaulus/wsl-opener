# `wsl-opener`

Programs like `rifle` and `xdg-open` are extremely useful for opening a
file with an appropriate program. However, things are a little weird
when operating within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

This short script is used to mimic the behavior of these types of
programs, but make things work as expected in WSL.
